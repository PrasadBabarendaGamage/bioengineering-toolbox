# ReadTheDocs FAQ

## Troubleshooting

### contents.rst not found
By default, readthedocs looks for a contents.rst file. However, by default sphinx creates an index.rst file. Readthedocs will therefore raise the following error:
```bash
Sphinx error:
master file /home/docs/checkouts/readthedocs.org/user_builds/bioengineering-toolbox/checkouts/latest/docs/source/contents.rst not found
```
To address this include the following line in the conf.py file:
```python
# Set the root rst to load. This is required to be named contents to allow
# readthedocs to host the docs using its default configuration.
master_doc = 'index'
```

### [My ReadTheDocs project isnâ€™t building](http://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#my-project-isn-t-building-with-autodoc)

First, you should check out the Builds tab of your project. That records all of the build attempts that RTD has made to build your project. If you see `ImportError` messages for custom Python modules, you should enable the virtualenv feature in the Admin page of your project, which will install your project into a virtualenv, and allow you to specify a `requirements.txt` file for your project.

You can create this file using the following steps

> **_NOTE:_**  The following steps assume you have successfully built the Sphinx documentation on your local machine (i.e. that all the required modules are installed on your machine).

Open the conf.py of your sphinx documentation (usually located inside the `docs` folder), and navigate to the extensions section (an example of which  is shown below)
```python
# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.
extensions = [
   'sphinx.ext.autodoc',
   'sphinx.ext.doctest',
   'sphinx.ext.intersphinx',
   'sphinx.ext.todo',
   'sphinx.ext.coverage',
   'sphinx.ext.imgmath',
   'sphinx.ext.viewcode'
]
```

The Extensions (or in other words - the python modules) that inbuilt into
Sphinx are denoted by ``the sphinx.`` prefix. The other python modules will
need to be installed when ReadTheDocs builds the documentation on their server.

To see what python modules are currently installed on your machine use the
following command in a terminal:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
Search in this file for the items that match the other python modules
required by ReadTheDocs (in the example above, search for ``sphinxcontrib``). Move these lines to the top of the file and delete the remaining lines.

Move the `requirements.txt` file in the documentation directory of
your repository (commonly labelled `docs`).

Add the location of this file to the ReadTheDocs project admin page and rebuild the documentation on ReadTheDocs.
